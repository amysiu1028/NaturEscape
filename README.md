## üí≠ Abstract
Explore the beauty of nature and history with NaturEscape! On our main page, you'll find a captivating display of parks and historic sites, complete with images and essential information. Use the convenient search bar to easily locate your preferred park or historic site by name. Upon clicking, dive into a detailed view showcasing images, descriptions, and additional insights provided by the API, including historical facts and location details. If you can't find a specific park, our search functionality will gracefully inform you. NaturEscape ensures a seamless user experience, allowing you to effortlessly connect with the wonders of nature and history.

## üìù Context
This project was a self-driven solo endeavor, completed over approximately 35-40 hours. Working independently, I took on the challenge of designing and implementing NaturEscape, a web application focused on showcasing parks and historic sites. The project involved various tasks, including front-end development, integration of technologies like React, SCSS, Lottie Web, and backend setup using Express and Knex.js. The entire development process was managed and tracked individually, demonstrating self-motivation and dedication to the project's success. The completion of NaturEscape reflects the culmination of skills acquired and applied through a self-driven, solo project.

## üöß Challenges
‚ùóI challenged myself to make this project visually more appealing than previous projects. I have been able to implement and learn new styling methods. It took awhile at times, but going forward, I have learned more. 
‚ùóNoticed that I had a lot of nested html elements which made it difficult for some cypress testing.
